                                Hi my name is Prabhjot Mattu. I was born in Santa Clara, California in 1997 and lived there until I moved to Texas when I was 7. Both of my parents were born in Punjab, a state in northern India, and immigrated to the US in the early 90's. I also have 1 sibling, a sister, who is 2 years younger than me. I also have 2 dogs, a 7 year old Chihuahua and an 11 month old Rottweiler. I went to Plano East High School and graduated in 2015. Since then I have been attending Collin College and I will be attending UTD starting in Fall 2017 to get my degreee in Computer Science. One of my hobbies is watching and playing sports. My favorite sport is basketball (Go Lakers!) and I try to get pickup games going among friends at least once a week. Spending time with my dogs on walks around the neighborhood is another one of favorite hobbies. I also love to listen to music in my free time, mainly Hip-Hop.
                            </p>

                                Currently I am a sophomore at Collin College. In the fall I will be transferring to the University of Texas at Dallas to pursue my degree in Computer Science. Currently my academic goal is to finish my Bachelors in Computer Science by Spring 2019. I do not have any plans to go to graduate school as it is not necessary for a career in software development. In software development I am not completely sure what I specifcally want to do yet but I am interested in web development. After graduating my dream job would be to work at one of the top tech companies such as Google, Microsoft, Apple, etc..

                            <p>Something in the news that I have thought deeply about would be the issue of illegal immigration. </p>
                            <ul>
                                <li> What is illegal immigration?</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>Illegal immigration is the process of entering a country to live there without following the immigration laws set in place by that country. </p>
                            <ul>
                                <li> Why do people illegally immigrate?</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>There are many reasons a person might immigrate illegally. One is that the process of immigrating legally is too long or difficult for them. Another reason is they are just seeking a better life and more opportunity. A person also might illegally immigrate to escape persecution or oppression.</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li> How do people illegally immigrate?</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>One way of illegally immigrating is crossing the border. This can be achieved by being smuggled on boats or crossing a physical border. Another way is to arrive in a country legally by obtaining a visa but not leaving when it expires. Sham marriages are another way of illegally immigrating an consist of marrying a person only to gain legal residency status.</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Describe the problems faced by illegal immigrants in their new country.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>Illegal immigrants usually have limited or no access to public services such as health care and education. They are also subject to exploitaion of their labor as employers are not required to follow employment laws. As a result they often make less than minimum wage and have unsafe working condition.</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>List the number of illegal immigrants in the US currently and recent policies that have been put in place to deter further illegal immigration.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>According the Pew Research Center there are around 11.3 million people currently living in the US illegally. In 2002 the Enhanced Border Security and Visa Entry Reform Act provided more Border Patrol agents and required schools to report foreign students. In 2005 the REAL ID Act required the use of IDs in order to increase security by requiring them to enter government building, open bank accounts, and board planes.</p>

                                In my quality world the people that I most associate with would be the friends that I have grown up with since I have moved to Texas. We have shared a ton of good memories together and I am always happy when I am with them. In my quality world the thing that I most want to achieve is to be successful in whatever I end up doing. Being successful in my quality world would mean that I would be able to take care of myself and my family and it would also mean that I am happy with what I do for a living. Basically I want to be as stress free as possible. Also in my quality world the values I would live by are the basic beliefs and principles of Sikhism. The basic beliefs and principles I strive for would be treating all people equally, living a moral life, working hard and honestly, and helping the poor and needy.

                            <p>A fixed mindset response from Sam would be saying I struggled at science in high school and I am struggling now so I will never get better at it. A growth mindset from Sam would be realizing that just because I struggled at science in high school does not mean I can't get better. So in college I will use all the resources available to me such as tutoring and group study sessions in order get better at science.</p>

Because there are only 3 of us we work together to solve any technical issue facing a dental office. I also use teamwork when volunteering. At my Gurdwara (Sikh Temple) we have a youth group that focuses on community service. Recently we have done things such as put on workshops for the community, making food for the homeless, and planting flowers for Earth day.
